# Consideration
#### **Scalability Considerations**:

-   **Sharding and Load Balancing**: Break down quiz sessions across different nodes or regions. Use Redis for fast, scalable pub/sub communication to keep leaderboards and scores in sync across all nodes.
-   **Caching**: Implement caching (e.g., Redis) for quiz questions and temporary leaderboard standings to reduce load on the database.
-   **Horizontal Scaling**: Scale out WebSocket servers to handle more connections by distributing users across multiple nodes using a load balancer.

##### **Trade-offs**:

-   **Complexity vs Performance**: Using Redis for pub/sub adds complexity but allows for extremely low-latency updates.
-   **Horizontal Scaling**: Each WebSocket server needs to know which quiz session it is responsible for, which adds a bit of coordination overhead.

----------

#### **Performance Considerations**:

-   **Batch Updates**: Instead of updating scores for each individual answer, batch updates to improve performance.
-   **WebSocket Connection Management**: Implement ping-pong health checks to close stale or inactive connections.

----------

#### **Reliability Considerations**:

-   **Retry Logic**: If an update fails (e.g., network issue), implement retry logic on both the client and server side.
-   **Graceful Error Handling**: Ensure that all errors are handled gracefully, especially during WebSocket disconnections or server crashes.
-   **Failover Mechanisms**: Use multiple instances of key services (e.g., Quiz Service, Leaderboard Service) to handle failover in case one instance goes down.

----------

#### **Monitoring and Observability**:

-   **Prometheus for Metrics**: Track metrics such as:
    -   Number of active quiz sessions
    -   Number of connected clients
    -   Latency for score updates
    -   Leaderboard refresh times
-   **Grafana Dashboards**: Set up dashboards to visualize real-time metrics.
-   **Logging**: Use structured logging (e.g., via ELK stack) for debugging any issues that arise in real-time communication.
